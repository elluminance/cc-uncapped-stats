# cc-uncapped-stats
Removes the visual stat caps in CrossCode, along with making minor UI adjustments to better fit the larger than intended numbers.

Requires CCLoader.

Note: Functionality exists as a part of [EL's Tweaks](https://github.com/EL20202/el-crosscode-tweaks) - meaning that if you have that mod installed, __installing Uncapped Stats separately is completely unnecessary.__ This still exists as a standalone mod for those who *only* want uncapped stat functionality.
